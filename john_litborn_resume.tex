        \item Recruited my second year at university, I taught courses in Python,
            \CPP, Ada and Matlab.
        \item Primarily introductory courses, where I held lessons with repetition
            and shared problem solving, lab assistant where I answered questions and
            helped solve problems, and correcting lab hand-ins and exams.
        \item Later on I also held more advanced courses, teaching the \CPP  standard
            library, git, object-oriented programming or unit-testing.
            I was also advisor on projects and grading documentation
            and hand-ins, and as head assistant taking on light
            administrative and managerial duties.

    \begin{itemize*}
        \item After being unhappy with a course and it's software and
            bringing it up to the professor, I was offered a summer job
            to improve it. Where I remade the assignments and improved the
            Python API for XPilot, a 2D multiplayer space shooter, that was
            used in the course.
        \item Using what I had learned in my teaching and my experience from
            the course I overhauled the structure of the assignments, changed,
            removed and added several ones and wrote better and clearer
            instructions and documentation, most of it in HTML.
        \item The XPilot-AI API in use was developed at Connecticut College,
            and after discussions with them I forked the project and begun
            modifying it to fix bugs and add features to suit our needs.
        \item My second year working on it I also started modifying the
            XPilot source code, written in C with heavy use of macros, and
            modified its network protocol to send more data so the client-side
            API for example didn't have to re-calculate the speed of objects.

    \begin{itemize*}
            \item Updated 4G base-station unit tests written in Erlang to work
                in a virtualized environment. I was the git-master in my team,
                and helped the other team members when they encountered problems
                with Git or Linux.
            \item I was also responsible for updating our sections on the
                internal Wiki, and wrote python and bash scripts to simplify
                rote tasks.

            full-time studies.
        \item I have almost exclusively studied part-time though, early on
            because of parallel work at the university, later on because of
            mental health issues.
        \item My second year I won a programming competition in a course on
            Computer Hardware and Architecture,
            which consisted of writing a sorting algorithm in microcode for
            a low-level simulated computer. My solution also beat the
            professors best implementation, and outclassed the previous student
            record.
